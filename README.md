# 🏎️ Formula 1 Data Analysis & Visualization Project
Formula 1 data analysis project using Python and SQL to uncover race performance and driver insights.

##📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning, transforming, and analyzing Formula 1 race data to extract meaningful insights about driver performance, team standings, and race trends. The project uses Power BI for data preprocessing and visualization along with Python for data exploration and analysis. The objective is to demonstrate real-world data analytics and business intelligence workflows.

##🎯 Project Objectives

* Clean and preprocess raw Formula 1 datasets

* Analyze driver and constructor performance

* Identify race trends and season patterns

* Build interactive dashboards for visualization

* Generate data-driven insights for sports analytics

##🗂 Dataset Description

* The dataset contains historical Formula 1 race data including:

* Driver information

* Constructor (team) details

* Race results and positions

* Points scored

* Circuit and season information

* Lap and performance statistics

* Dataset is used for educational and portfolio purposes.

##🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power BI)

* Data cleaning was performed using Power BI Power Query Editor:

* Removed null and missing values

* Standardized column names and formats

* Converted data types for numerical analysis

* Removed duplicate records

* Filtered irrelevant and invalid entries

* Created calculated and derived columns

* Prepared clean dataset for dashboard reporting

* This process follows the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow used in real-world analytics projects.

##🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

* Power BI (Data Cleaning, Transformation & Dashboarding)

* Python (Data Analysis)

* Pandas & NumPy

* SQL (if applicable)

* Jupyter Notebook

* GitHub

##🔍 Analysis Performed

* The project includes analysis such as:

* Driver performance comparison

* Team (constructor) ranking analysis

* Points distribution analysis

* Race outcome trends

* Season-wise performance tracking

* Top drivers and teams identification

📊 Dashboard & Visualization

* Power BI dashboards were created to visualize:

* Driver and team standings

* Race performance metrics

* Points distribution
